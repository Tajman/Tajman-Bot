# Functionalities 
The bot can respond to hello response from a user, it can generate a random number between 1 and 6 when a user types "roll". The user can also request the current weather stats for a certain city, zip code, country, and state by typing "!weather" along with the location in question. Stock info can also be generated for the current daily values. All that needs to be typed is "!stocks" along with the stock name of the stock in question, and the date of that daily value (in year/month/day format). Current date can also be stated with "!date". Word definitions can now be generated with the bot by typing "!defintion" with the word to be looked up.
